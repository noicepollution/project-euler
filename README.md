# project-euler
Python solutions to Project Euler questions. Ongoing project.

---
This repository contains noicepollution's solutions for Project Euler questions. All the solutions are written are in Python.

As of this moment, there are 87 solutions. If some of them are not available in the repository, chances are that they will be uploaded soon.

Almost all the codes have some explanation of the approach taken. For some problems, the solution is extrapolated in more detail. All the codes run with Python 3.7+.

Some of the codes written years ago, when I was just beginning to learn coding. And so, a good number of those codes contain inefficient, non-optimal approaches to the problem at hand. I intend on revisiting these codes later on and revising the approaches and the code. Most of the codes run under 1 minute, which is the benchmark defined by Project Euler.

At some point in the future, I will add information regarding the running times of each code.
